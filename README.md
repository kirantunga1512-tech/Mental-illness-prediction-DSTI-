# ðŸ§  Mental Illness Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of mental illness based on patient characteristics data from the *New York State Office of Mental Health (PCS 2019)* dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Dataset: 76 features, 196,102 rows (PCS 2019 survey data).
- Target: Mental Illness (Yes/No).
- Models trained: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Neural Network (MLP).
- Techniques used: Data preprocessing, SMOTE for imbalance handling, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline (EDA â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Model Training â†’ Evaluation).
- Handles class imbalance using *SMOTE*.
- Web app deployment using *Flask/Streamlit*.
- Predictions can be made via a simple user interface.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Logistic Regression achieved the *best CV F1 Score = 0.9515*.
- Decision Tree was the *second-best* with CV F1 = 0.9476.
